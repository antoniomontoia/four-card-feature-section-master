## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I solidified my knowledge of Flexbox by effectively using the flex property to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

I put SASS to good use, which helped me structure my CSS more efficiently and maintain a clean, organized codebase through the use of variables, nesting, and mixins.

I gained experience in implementing responsive design principles, ensuring that the layout looks great on various devices and screen sizes.

I practiced debugging and troubleshooting layout issues, enhancing my problem-solving skills in web development.


### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to focus on the following areas:

Refining Flexbox Skills: I aim to continue trimming my knowledge of Flexbox, exploring more advanced techniques and use cases to create even more complex and responsive layouts.

Deepening CSS Grid Understanding: I want to delve deeper into CSS Grid, learning how to leverage its capabilities for creating intricate grid-based layouts. I plan to experiment with grid templates, areas, and responsive design techniques to enhance my layout skills.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com) - This helped me getting started with CSS Grid. Even if it was not necessary for this project, I highly recommend it.
- [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies) - This is an amazing way of solidifying flexbox knowledge.
